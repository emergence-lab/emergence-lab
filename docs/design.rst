UI Design Thoughts

General Thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The vision for this project is to create a data-/experiment-driven project management webapp. The most important information are growths, characterization, and processing. Additional information includes journal entries to annotate general thoughts and comparison pages to investigate changes to characterization information between growths or samples.

Important Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Common Activities
        - Start growth
        - Search growths/samples
        - New journal entry
        - Compare characterization
        - Graph data (?)

    * Display Relevant Information
        - Reactor scheduling
        - Recent activity (global)

    * Project Management
        - Recent activity (per-project/investigation)
        - Collaborator information
        - Calendar (?)

Layout
~~~~~~

    * View information on a per-project or per-investigation basis
    * Add journal entries on a per-project and per-investigation basis
    * Action buttons auto-fill in information depending on which project/investigation is filled out

Potential Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Multiple projects/investigations per growth
    * Currently, project/investigation is on a per-growth basis. Any need for per-sample tracking?


News Feed
---------

General Thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    A very important UI element that helps keep track of progress. With the inclusion of journal entries and characterization comparison the goal is to replace the master document with the news feed. Displays updates on a per-operator/project/investigtion basis including growths, characterization, processing, journal entries, and comparisons.
